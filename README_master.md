# Tensorflow_pytorch
Notebooks that teach these two major ML models

Machine learning is about automating the use of data to gather insights, and then move ahead to create models. 

Tensorflow and Pytorch are mostly sited by many practitioners and masters in the field of ML. Whether it is NLP or CV, even simple ML can be sped up 
using the models created in tensorflow or pytorch. 

The repo will consist of notebooks that introduce mainly data manipulation, model training and generation concepts. The repo will contain many NBs
that I find useful to save for later use. 

Fascination with playing with massive datasets, and getting insights has been my life long passion.
